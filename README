What is this?
=============

ROOTure |ˈrʌtʃə| is modest attempt at having a LISP-like language where
[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) is a first class citizen. This means that the
language itself not only tries to simplify interoperability with ROOT but
considers by design the ROOT object model as a fundation of its own APIs.

If you are thinking this is similar to what happens with
[Clojure](http://clojure.org) and Java, you get exactly the idea.

The initial implementation comes from the very nice tutorial ["Build your own
LISP"](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com).

This is not meant for production but you can still amuse yourself with it.
